## The Setup: David vs. Goliath in Financial Forecasting

In the world of machine learning, bigger is often assumed to be better. Foundation models with hundreds of millions of parameters dominate headlines, promising to revolutionize everything from language to time series forecasting. So when I set out to evaluate 8 different algorithms for predicting NVIDIA stock prices using 5-minute trading data, I expected the latest AI models to reign supreme.

**I was completely wrong.**

The results of my comprehensive analysis, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/matthewchung74/stock_algo_eval), tell a fascinating story about the limits of complexity and the enduring power of domain expertise in financial markets.

## The Contenders: From Simple Statistics to 311M Parameter Monsters

I tested 8 different approaches on high-frequency NVIDIA stock data (5-minute bars from May 2020 to May 2025):

### Traditional & Statistical Methods:
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** (Geometric Brownian Motion)
- **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- **Prophet** (Facebook's time series forecasting tool)

### Machine Learning:
- **XGBoost** (Gradient boosting with 92 engineered features)

### Foundation Models (The AI Heavy Hitters):
- **Chronos** (Amazon's T5-based model, 60M parameters)
- **Moirai** (Salesforce's foundation model, 311M parameters)
- **TimesFM/ASFM** (Advanced Statistical Foundation Model)

## The Shocking Results: David Wins by a Landslide

Here's what happened when I tested all models on a volatile 3-hour trading period:

| Algorithm | Type | MAE ($) | Direction Accuracy | Key Features |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| **XGBoost** | ML Ensemble | **$0.04** | **80.0%** | 92 engineered features |
| **Monte Carlo** | Statistical | $0.52 | 41.7% | Perfect risk assessment |
| **ARIMA** | Statistical | $0.52 | 41.7% | Perfect confidence intervals |
| **Chronos** | Foundation Model (60M) | $0.59 | 58.3% | Zero-shot capability |
| **Moirai (Zero-Shot)** | Foundation Model (311M) | $1.69 | 40.0% | Patch-based transformer |
| **TimesFM/ASFM** | Foundation Model | $2.10 | 55.6% | Multi-component approach |
| **Prophet** | Statistical | $13.11 | 58.3% | Trend + seasonality |
| **Moirai (Fine-tuned)** | Foundation Model | $48.42 | 27.3% | Custom implementation |

**The winner?** XGBoost with hand-crafted features achieved **13x better accuracy** than the next best model and **42x better** than the largest foundation model.

## Why Traditional Methods Dominated

### 1. **Feature Engineering Beats Raw Neural Power**

XGBoost's secret weapon wasn't computational complexity—it was **domain expertise**. The model used 92 carefully engineered features:

- **Price momentum indicators** (EMA, SMA, price ratios)
- **Technical analysis features** (support/resistance levels, volatility measures)
- **Volume patterns** (volume trends, ratios, moving averages)
- **Temporal features** (time of day, day of week effects)

The top features revealed what actually drives short-term price movements:
1. **5-period EMA** (61.4% importance) - Recent price momentum
2. **Previous price** (23.5% importance) - Immediate trend continuation
3. **Recent support/resistance levels** (14.3% combined) - Technical analysis basics

### 2. **Statistical Rigor Provides Unmatched Reliability**

While foundation models struggled with uncertainty quantification, traditional statistical methods excelled:

- **Monte Carlo & ARIMA**: Achieved **100% confidence interval coverage**
- **Perfect risk assessment**: Essential for real trading applications
- **Consistent performance**: Reliable across different market conditions

### 3. **Implementation Quality Trumps Model Sophistication**

The most telling result was the custom fine-tuned Moirai model, which performed **worse than random guessing**. This highlights a crucial insight: **a well-implemented simple model beats a poorly implemented complex one every time**.

## The Foundation Model Reality Check

### What Went Wrong with AI Models?

1. **Scale Doesn't Equal Performance**: The 311M parameter Moirai model was outperformed by much simpler approaches
2. **Zero-shot Limitations**: While impressive, foundation models lack the domain-specific knowledge that financial markets demand
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Custom fine-tuning is extremely challenging and error-prone
4. **Data Efficiency**: Traditional methods work better with limited training data (8,000 samples)

### What Foundation Models Got Right

Not everything was doom and gloom for AI models:
- **Chronos** achieved competitive performance with excellent probabilistic forecasting
- **Zero-shot capability** is genuinely valuable for quick deployment
- **Uncertainty quantification** shows promise when properly calibrated

## The Market Efficiency Hypothesis Strikes Back

These results align with a fundamental principle in finance: **markets are efficient**. High-frequency price movements in liquid stocks like NVIDIA may simply not contain the complex patterns that deep learning models excel at finding.

Instead, the predictable elements are:
- **Short-term momentum** (captured by moving averages)
- **Technical support/resistance levels** (captured by min/max features)
- **Recent price action** (captured by lagged features)

These patterns are exactly what traditional technical analysis and feature engineering can capture effectively.

## Practical Implications for Practitioners

### 1. **Start Simple, Then Optimize**
Before reaching for the latest foundation model, implement and perfect traditional approaches. They often provide the best baseline and may be all you need.

### 2. **Domain Expertise > Model Complexity**
Time spent understanding market microstructure and engineering relevant features often yields better returns than experimenting with larger models.

### 3. **Risk Management First**
Statistical models' superior uncertainty quantification makes them invaluable for real trading applications where risk management is paramount.

### 4. **Implementation Quality Matters Most**
A perfectly implemented ARIMA model will outperform a buggy transformer every time. Focus on getting the basics right.

## The Broader Lessons

This analysis reveals important truths that extend beyond financial forecasting:

### 1. **The Complexity Trap**
More parameters don't automatically mean better performance. The optimal model complexity depends on your data characteristics and implementation quality.

### 2. **Domain Knowledge Is Irreplaceable**
Foundation models trained on diverse datasets may lack the specific insights that domain experts can encode through feature engineering.

### 3. **Evaluation Rigor Is Critical**
Testing on volatile periods (rather than flat markets) revealed true performance differences that would otherwise be hidden.

## Future Directions: The Best of Both Worlds

Rather than abandoning either approach, the future likely lies in hybrid methods:

- **Foundation models for feature extraction** + traditional predictors
- **Ensemble methods** combining statistical reliability with neural network pattern recognition
- **Better fine-tuning approaches** specifically designed for financial time series

## Conclusion: Respect the Fundamentals

In an era obsessed with AI breakthroughs, this analysis serves as a humbling reminder: **fundamentals matter**. Domain expertise, careful feature engineering, and rigorous implementation often trump raw computational power.

For financial practitioners, the message is clear: before chasing the latest AI trend, master the traditional tools. They're not just competitive—they might be superior.
